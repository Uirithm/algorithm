# Algorithm
This project is for studying data structures & algorithms with the members of Uirithm.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Coding style?

### 1. < algorithm name >.cpp
### 2. if-endif precompiler
  
  - Please add the "#if, #endif" clauses at the top & bottom of the file as follows:
  
  ```
  <stack.cpp>
  
  #if 1
  
  /* Your codes */
  
  #endif 
  
  ```
  
  so that we can easily have it excluded from a build in the Visual Studio IDE. Just change "#if 1" to "#if 0" for this.
  
### 3. Comment

  - Any Korean/English comments are welcomed. :)
